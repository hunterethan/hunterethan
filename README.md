### Currently a he/him computer science student at CMU, who likes snowboarding, skateboarding, disc golfing, concerts, and souls-likes. I also have ADHD which means i've started countless other hobbies I didn't follow through, including whatever you're into. I'm currently focusing on learning machine learning with python for a data science path.
